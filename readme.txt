I decided to build a website showcasing products of affiliates as part of an advertising program where I (the publisher) would make a 
small commision from any sale made from a user that entered the advertisers website through a link from mine within a month.

I used the spring boot project slides for Tech Talent South Blog.  After a few days I was able to get all the functions of the project to work. 
I began changing the look of the site using bootstrap and thymeleaf.  I then researed google stats to see what was most searched for on google 
shopping.  It was women boots.   Then I needed a name for the site that wasn't already taken.  It had to have the word "Boots" for seo reasons.
I came up with AllWomensBoots.com but decided to please my wife with her creation, "AllThingsBoots."  It was catchy, easy to remember and it 
now included men and children.

I signed up for programs to get links to populate the site and this is the result for now.  It will be live soon and I want to add login for myself.
I also wish to add automatic calls to the advertisers site for product links through their api.  

Thankyou!
